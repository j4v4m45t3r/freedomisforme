					 Web browsers are the programs that we run in order to acess websites. With all of the data being handled by these programs, it is very important that you have a private, secure browser. Web browsers such as Chrome, collect a lot of very sensitive data on its users. Chrome logs the websites you visit, what you do on them, it logs your cookies, and attempts to get your credentials with its built in password manager.
				</p>
				
				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					 And outsite of the browser itself spying on you, the websites you visit can to. Most browsers are not designed to stop websites from logging your information. A great example of this is <a href="https://deviceinfo.me" target="_blank" class="regular">deviceinfo.me</a>. This website does not log your information, but shows you what it can figure out. The browsers that I will talk about in this section will not only not spy on you, but also prevent the websites you visit from logging your info, and tracking you.
				</p>

			<div id="Firefox" class="content">
				<h1 class="center-header">
					Firefox
				</h1>

				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					<a class="regular" target="_blank" href="https://mozilla.org">Firefox</a> has a quite a history of being a good, private web browser. While it is not the most private, it is still a very good browser. Unfortunately, due to some changes that have happened to the company that is responsible for Firefox, Mozilla, it is not as private as it once was, and is actually quite bloated. Luckilly with a little modification firefox can become an incredibly private, and secure web browser. <a class="regular" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZpjKH8nbo">This video</a> by the content creator Mental Outlaw is a very good tutorial on improving the diminished state of this browser.
				</p>

				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					All things considered, despite Firefox having some issues, and requiring modification to make it truly private, I would highly recommend this browser, with or without modification, to anyone looking to up their privacy, whilst still having a feature rich browser. It is more secure and private than most browsers, and is still pretty user friendly.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="Brave" class="content">
				<h1 class="center-header">
					Brave
				</h1>

				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					<a class="regular" target="_blank" href="https://brave.com">Brave</a> is a robust, privacy and freedom focused web browser, that is incredibly feature rich. It has add blocking built in, and does a good job at blocking trackers on the web. It is highly customizable, and runs very quickly. In my opinion it is a bit bloated, with some features such as a built in crypto wallet, and the ability to switch to using the Tor network, being in my opinion unnecessary, and something that I feel should not be built into a browser. It is private however, and does promote freedom, and is a good out for big tech if your new to private browsers and such.
				</p>

				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					If you have been using Chrome for a long time and are very new to using private browsers, Brave is a good choice as it is quite private, and is very feature rich. You can customize it greatly, and it runs pretty fast. If you are a little more experienced with staying private and safe online, I would not recommend Brave, as it does have many excessive features. LibreWolf is a much better choice, but Brave does do the job.
				</p>

			<div id="LibreWolf" class="content">
				<h1 class="center-header">
					LibreWolf
				</h1>

				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					<a class="regular" target="_blank" href="https://librewolf.net">LibreWolf</a> is a privacy and freedom focused fork of Firefox. It is completely open source, and is community driven. It is a very fast browser, that is very customizable. It also supports all of Firefox's themes and addons. This is what I personally use as my main browser, although I have modified it in a similar way that I mentioned in the Firefox section. It is incredibly private even out-of-the-box, with no modifications, and comes with uBlock Origin installed. It does not collect telemetry data, is updated very frequently, and has been hardened to be as secure and private as possible. It also has several feature to stop websites from just being plain annoying, such as stopping window resizing from JS. 
				</p>

				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					All in all, I would highly recommend this browser to anyone. It is incredibly private, open source, community driven, and feature rich, while still being fast. It is incredibly well maintained, and very secure, with many features to stop websites from tracking you. It is a very good browser, that is incredibly user friendly, and is highly customizable.

			<div id="TorBrowser" class="content">
				<h1 class="center-header">
					Tor Browser
				</h1>

				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					<a class="regular" target="_blank" href="https://torproject.org">Tor Browser</a> is the most secure, and private web browser in the world. It is based on Firefox, completely open source, and does not collect any data on you at all. It is also incredibly secure, and spoofs practically everything about your computer that can be spoofed. It is also the only recommended way to acess onion sites. You see, Tor stands for The Onion Routing Project, the reason it is called this is because of the way that it masks your identity. I will not go into the full detail of how this works as it is a bit out of the scope of this section, however I will touch on the basics. Pretty much, Tor sends your data through three nodes that are run by volunteers around the world, so that every site you go to can only see the information of the last node your data is being sent through. On top of that every node completely encrypts your data, using different keys.
				</p>

				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					It is next to impossible to trace somone using Tor if they practice good OPSEC. Besides from Tor letting you browse the web almost completely anonomously, it also lets you bypass censorship. If a country blocks acess to some websites, Tor is almost garunteed to get past that. However, some countries will try to block Tor itself, which is why there are Tor bridges. Tor bridges are exactly what they sound like, they effectivly serve as a proxy for the Tor network so that you can acess it undected. The only downside to using Tor is that it can be slow depending on how much the Feds decide to DDOS the network that day.
				</p>

				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					I would absolutely 100% recommend this browser to any person at all. It is the most private and secure browser ever made. I do not recommend using this as your main browser however, as the security features break most websites. This browser is definitely something you will want installed on your computer, or phone, if you want to avoid censorship, or spying.

			<div id="Bromite" class="content">
				<h1 class="center-header">
					Bromite
				</h1>

				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					<a class="regular" target="_blank" href="https://bromite.org">Bromite</a> is an open source, privacy enhanced fork of chromium for Android. While chromium is not a great browser for privacy and security, it is very robust. This specific fork of it has add blocking built in, along with many other privacy features. It is fairly lightweight and a good choice for people that want a good, private browser on their phone, whilst not sacrificing memory, and features. Bromite has also made Bromite SystemWebView, which is an incredible open-source, private web view alternative to the default one installed on Android.
				</p>

				<br/>
				<br/>

				<p>
					Bromite is a good browser choice for Android. It is not the most private browser available, but it does provide a lot of security. It is very optimized and is my personal choice for the phone, as it is lightweight, while still being a robust browser. It works very well, is updated fairly frequently, and does do quite a good job at stopping spying. It does not collect telemetry data, and the add blocking built in works quite well. I would absolutely recommend this browser.
