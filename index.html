					Hello, and welcome to my website! I am a java programmer with a passion for HTML and privacy. I am a firm believer that we should try to stay as safe, and free, online as possible, which is why I made this website. The whole purpose of this site is to provide FOSS ( free and open source ), alternatives to software that you might be using. I will also discuss how to stay private online, and how to improve your cybersecurity. I hope that you will be able to learn something new, and maybe create a site like this of your own.

					I am a Java programmer, who is also a privacy and security enthusiast. I beleive that people should try to stay as private online as possible, while also ensuring that they won't get hacked. I enjoy helping people stay private online, which is why I created this site. I hope to allow people to see resources to help them stay safe, and private.
